## About this project 📚

As a college student, I see a lot of friends struggling to sell their raffles for prom or freshman parties a lot. Their biggest problem is always find a good way to promote their product and finding people willing to buy them. Knowing this, I created the Easy Raffle platform, where they can registrate their raffle and finding buyers in the easiest way possible.
